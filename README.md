# GameTheory-Blockchain
Use of Benevolent Cooperation to create fair Reward Distribution Policy. 

This project focusses on finding such a reward distribution policy in blockchain that would remove pool-wars between miners and hence lay down such policies that would make miners to mine fairly.
As pool-wars could be minimized by using application of Game Theory concepts in blockchain,hence this project suggests a reward distribution policy which is based on Benevolent Cooperation.

Python is used to create our own blockchain which performs all basic functionalities of the standard blockchain like it has its own block number , hash value , proof-of-work , previous blockâ€™s hash value etc. it also supports the basic consensus behind blockchain i.e., every node must contains the longest chain.Here different nodes are used that will correspond to the different mining pools.
Postman is being used to allow different nodes to mine block, add transactions etc. to the blockchain.

In this project Miner1.py and Miner2.py are the code for the blockchain present with the respective miner.
Format of the data to be used while communicating with blockchain using postman could be found in the json attached.
For more information refer the user_ guide attached.
